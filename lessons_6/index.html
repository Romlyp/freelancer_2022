                    <h2>Employee Engagement Statistics</h2>
                    <p>As you probably know, one of the hardest jobs that falls to the HR department is keeping
                        employees engaged in their work and the company.</p>
                    <p>Theese HR statistics prove that motivating your employees and being considerate of their
                        passions
                        boosts engagement.</p>
                    <p>In the coming year, support your employee’s professional development by challenging them
                        with
                        goals within their reach, to keep them engaged and motivated to take on the next challenge!
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In early 2021 Gallup found that 36% of U.S. employees were engaged in their work and
                            workplace. Globally, 20% of employees are engaged at work. (Gallup).</li>
                        <li>45% of employees feel emotionally drained from their work and the younger the employee, the
                            more likely they are to report these sentiments. (SHRM)
                        </li>
                        <li>Less satisfied respondents reported lower average work and life outcomes than more satisfied
                            peers did—everything from reduced feelings of energy and life satisfaction to lower
                            engagement, satisfaction, and excitement about work. (McKinsey & Company)</li>
                        <li>Nearly 70 percent of professionals who transitioned to remote work because of the pandemic
                            say they now work on the weekends, and 45 percent say they regularly work more hours during
                            the week than they did before, according to a survey of 2,800 workers by Los Angeles-based
                            staffing firm Robert Half.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Job Satisfaction Statistics</h2>
                    <p>If you’re passionate about HR, you probably care about whether your employees are satisfied with
                        their roles. There are a lot of factors that go into employee satisfaction, and the HR
                        statistics show that every employee wants something different out of their job. So, how do you
                        keep everyone happy? Start with the little things, like building relationships based on respect
                        and trust.</p>
                    <p>A few stand-out employee satisfaction statistics to keep in mind:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>US employees are less engaged, less productive, and less positive about their career due to
                            COVID-19. (Eagle Hill Consulting)</li>
                        <li>Job satisfaction was not impacted by Covid-19: job satisfaction went from its lowest rate of
                            42.6% in 2010 to 56.9% in 2020. This was, in part, due to companies checking in on their
                            employees more, and compassionate benefits being offered, like flexible hours or healthcare
                            benefits. (The Conference Board)</li>
                        <li>Of the group of employees working in non remote positions with little workplace flexibility,
                            70.5 percent report negative work effectiveness, with 50.4 percent feeling disengaged and
                            57.6 percent saying they’re struggling.(McKinsey & Company)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Performance Management Statistics</h2>
                    <p>Keeping track of employee performance can be tough at the best of times—and it gets tougher as
                        your company grows. On top of that, a recent trend has been an increase in performance reviews
                        and feedback. Keep up with performance management tools like Factorial or Oracle, and stay on
                        top of your employees using the HR statistics below.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>75% Senior HR Managers agree that collaboration, constant communication and a mentorship
                            culture between managers and teams will become the future mandate of a high performing
                            workplace. (Cision)
                        </li>
                        <li>22% of organisations are asking managers to focus more on behaviours than outcomes when
                            assessing performance this year, and 12% are asking managers to focus more on outcomes than
                            behaviours.(HRD)</li>
                    </ul>
